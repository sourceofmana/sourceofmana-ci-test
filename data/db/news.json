A lot of things are being built from scratch or are newly adapted for Godot, so most of these changes are designed to prepare the game for a future prototype release. New builds are now available for download. We encourage you to take a look and let us know what you think.\n\nSource of Mana has grown a lot over the past month, our seedling of a project is finally sprouting into the wonderful tree it will one day become. The 0.0.1 release was downloaded nearly 100 times, which we consider pretty good for such a small prototype.\n\nChangelog:\n[ul]Game ported to Godot 4.0 (Beta 2) after initially being built on Godot 3.5;\nAdded minimap support;\nImproved Tiled map imports to work with Godot 4.0;\nAdded various GUI elements including windows, buttons, and fonts;\nAdded support for emotes (as well as new TMW-style emotes that will be coming with future releases!);\nVarious GUI, navigation, and build fixes;\nNew story design in progress for a central storyline and to incorporate Mana into our World.[/ul]\n"

					"content": "\tHello Mana world,\n\nOur prototype and first version of Source of Mana is now available to download on our itch.io page.\n\nFor this first version, the changelog would be pretty large, so instead, I prefer to present you on the main lines what we have been trying to achieve:\n\nOur ambition was to create a working offline prototype of what could be TMW within Godot in 2022, we prepared a basic code, asset, project architectures, and a game design document to support our game development.\n\nOur code rolls with a service system that can be enabled/disabled from a main scene. Multiple scenes will be created within the same Godot project to generate a server, a client, and a launcher.\n\nOur asset regroups what was previously done on TMW and rEvolt, we are preparing a new git repository to work like a giant asset store that features all available content that can be featured on SoM based on the quality and needs of these assets.\n\nOur project will be managed through Gitlab's built-in agile planning with a \"Milestone\" release plan.\n\nOur game design is currently being redacted into a Game Design Document that will feature all of the main designs and focus we will want to address.\n\nAside from all of these plans, our First Playable Preview release features a playable character with basic walk and sit actions that can wander inside a cave by mouse, keyboard, and gamepad.\nGodot's benefits are many but the most important is the easy release process that helps us to prepare builds for different platforms like Linux, MacOS, Windows, and Android.\n"
